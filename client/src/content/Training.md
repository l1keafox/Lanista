# Training

Training your abilities up is the most important thing you can do. Your gladiators will always be growing and leveling up.

The base school abilities are the least gained. You will want to decide on which buildings, but there will be a 3 tier system to start.

```
Tier 1 - Gain gold/fame
Tier 2 - It will only gain stats, but no gold/fame.
Tier 3 - It will cost gold/fame.
Tier 4 - It will cost both gold/fame and stats.
```

The goal of a school is to become profitable enough that you can train a champion. A champion will have the highest Tier training, and the school support system to sustain it.
