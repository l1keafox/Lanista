<h1> Memories </h1>
Your gladiator will automatically be saved each time it enters a tournament. This is called a Memory, and when you enter a tournament you will be fighting other gladiators Memories.

This will insure that all Duels will be of equal age gladiators. You will also have different ages that are saved as a Memory that will fight other gladiators as they age.
