# Balance

Balance in a game like this is important. Your gladiators will only be fighting other gladiators around it's age. So here are some design thoughts.

1. Items will not be tiered, there will never be a copper sword and a iron sword

2. Min maxing needs to be spread out. Focusing on 1 stat can not be the most successful.

3. Balance over lore - somethings might not make lots of sense together.
